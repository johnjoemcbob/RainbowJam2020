I think there'll be an ink file for each story part, then this has
redirects to each port possible, which will show the responses from these two people being linked
so up here is the introduction, the person calls and asks the operator for a bread

=== Port1 ===
This person cannot supply bread!

-> END

=== Port2 ===
Mama mia its the baker person! Bread incoming!

-> END

=== Port3 ===
Not only do I have no bread, I am a fascism and breads are illegal!

-> END
