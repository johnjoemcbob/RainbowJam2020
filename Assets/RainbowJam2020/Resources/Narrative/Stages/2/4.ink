Hello. Did I send this properly?
Tell me if I didn’t...wait.
Um, I should explain!
The farmers’ pay hasn’t come through,
so they need a scribe to get in touch with you,
and I’m...almost one.
Anyway, can you put me through to your boss?
I’m sure there’s just been a mix-up...

I knew he’d understand once I explained it to him! Thank you for connecting me!
