Calling you from Ugarit now. Things are
worse than we thought here. It’s bad enough
without blaming the victims...
If a starving person has to break some
stuff to survive, how cruel do you have to
be to make them the villain?
I’ve asked you for a lot, but these
people will need at least one more
shipment to make it through the famine.
I’m counting on you.
