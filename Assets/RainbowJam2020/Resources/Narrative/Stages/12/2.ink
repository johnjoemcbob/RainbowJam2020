Calling you from Ugarit now. Things are worse than we thought here. It’s bad enough without blaming the victims...if a starving person has to break some stuff to survive, how cruel do you have to be to make them the villain?

I know I’ve asked you for a lot, but this city’s people are going to need at least one more shipment to make it through the remainder of this famine. I’m counting on you.
