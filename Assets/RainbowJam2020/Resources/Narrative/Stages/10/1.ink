This is a fine time for grain to be going somewhere other than the capital! What if a crop fails on top of this? If I find out who’s responsible for this...why is our produce in Crete?! Speaking of which, Knossos is acting like this is my fault! That’s on you to answer!

I can only put out so many fires at once. Either rein in the farmers, or placate the priestess of Knossos. We can’t afford to lose any more trading partners, understand? If we still have both of these problems tomorrow, the depth of my displeasure will be beyond what you can IMAGINE!
